The actual app is completely irrelevant - do a 
page that displays your three favourite 
colours with an admin panel where you can change
the entries. Do a Spring project. Include some
cloud stack (AWS/Azure/GCP) where you save 
stuff. Maybe audit stuff. Make some web UI for 
whatever your build and then dive into Spring 
security. Care about logging and export logging
to an external service. Do exception handling.
Do TDD... or at least write test after you've 
coded your business logic (like 99% of people 
who say they're doing TDD). Of course, save 
everything to a database. Structure the layers 
of your app. Switch the dB - just for fun ðŸ˜Š. 
Deep dive into JPA, structured statements, 
Lombok,... Containerize your app, make a CI/CD 
pipeline for it. Build some monitoring for it. 
The learning opportunities are endless even if 
the actual app is boring and useless af.
